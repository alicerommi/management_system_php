    						<p>When a reservation is made by you through the <span class="company_link">MAXHYPECHANNEL</span> Site or <span class="company_link">MAXHYPECHANNEL</span> Application, the Restaurant may provide confirmation of the reservation to you by email or SMS via <span class="company_link">MAXHYPECHANNEL</span> systems.</p>

							<p><span class="company_link">MAXHYPECHANNEL</span> may use debit or credit card information as described in our privacy policy which will be collected securely via Stripe (our third party payment processor), but <span class="company_link">MAXHYPECHANNEL</span> shall have no liability for any charges made to the debit or credit card account for any failure to cancel your reservation in accordance with any Restaurant’s and Bar’s cancellation policy.</p>


							<h6>d.	Usage Guidelines</h6>

You further agree not to book more than one reservation for your personal use during any one meal or drink time.
