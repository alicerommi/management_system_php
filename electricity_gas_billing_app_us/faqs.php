											<h6 class="faq_heading">What if I don’t have a copy of my most recent energy bill?</h6>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="faq_ans">We will still be able to give energy quotes providing you can give us an estimate of your monthly bill and tell us who your current provider is. Having a copy of your bill just means that we can provide more accurate quotes. If you would rather wait to know your exact monthly amount, you could have a look at your bank statement, contact your energy provider for a copy of your bill, or if you have an online account, log in to download a recent copy.</p>

											<h6 class="faq_heading">
												Who is the best energy provider for businesses?
											</h6>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>

											<p class="faq_ans">The energy market was once dominated by what’s commonly referred to as the ‘big six’ energy providers: British Gas, npower, Scottish Power, EDF, E-On and SSE. However, with the rise in independent providers, consumers now have more options to choose from. Here at Instant Energy Savings, we work with 26 energy suppliers to give our customers access to the most comprehensive range of energy deals.</p>

												Who is the cheapest energy provider for businesses?
											</h6>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>

											<p class="faq_ans">Finding the cheapest energy provider depends on several factors, including your location and how much you currently pay for gas and electric. The best way to find the cheapest energy deal for your business is to compare suppliers. Our comparison engine can give you access to a huge range of deals from a number of suppliers —  including the ‘big six’ and independent energy providers — so that you can choose the right deal for your business and your budget.</p>

											How do I reduce business energy consumption?
											</h6>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>

											<p class="faq_ans">Finding a cheaper energy deal is a great way to cut bills, but if you want to reduce energy consumption, you will need to make small changes to how you use energy around your business. Our resource guides and blogs are full of helpful advice on how you can reduce energy usage.</p>

												<h6 class="faq_heading">
											How do I change my business energy provider?
											</h6>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>

											<p class="faq_ans">If you are on a fixed rate tariff, you will normally be locked into that contract for an agreed length of time, this could be up to 5 years. If you’re unsure what your contract length is, you can check with your energy provider. When your contract is due to end, you can start looking for a new deal 6 months before you need to switch. If you are on a variable rate tariff, you can normally switch to a different tariff or provider once you have given your current provider 30 days’ notice. You can find out what deals are available to you by using our comparison engine. This will give you access to a wide range of deals and tariffs from over 14 energy providers. Simply choose the one that suits your business and complete the purchase online. We will then take care of all the arrangements, including negotiations between your suppliers.</p>

											How much could I reduce my energy bill by if I switch with Instant Energy Savings?
											</h6>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>


											<p class="faq_ans">How much you can save on your energy bill depends on a number of factors, including your location, how much you currently pay and fluctuations in market unit costs (which is why quotes can be different from day to day).
